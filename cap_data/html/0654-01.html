    <p id="p-10"><a id="p1252" href="#p1252" data-label="1252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1252</a>Petitioner Maureen Hikida seeks review of an order of respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (the Board) affirming the decision of the workers' compensation judge (WCJ) to apportion the permanent total disability suffered by petitioner between industrial and nonindustrial causes prior to issuing its award. Petitioner contends that because the agreed medical examiner (AME) concluded her permanent total disability was the result of a failed surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition she contracted primarily due to the clerical work she performed for respondent Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco) for more than 25 years, apportionment was not appropriate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After briefing on the merits was complete, respondents filed a supplemental brief raising a "question" as to this court's jurisdiction. Specifically, respondents suggested the writ petition might have been untimely, because the issue of apportionment was resolved by the Board months before the Board denied reconsideration of the WCJ's final award. We conclude the petition was timely filed. We further conclude that despite significant changes in the law governing workers' compensation in 2004, disability resulting from medical treatment for which the employer is responsible is not subject to apportionment. Accordingly, we annul the Board's order and remand for an increase in petitioner's disability award.</p>
    <p id="p-11"><strong>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</strong></p>
    <p id="p-12">Petitioner was employed by respondent Costco from November 1984 to May 2010. During this period, she developed a number of medical conditions, including carpel tunnel syndrome.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a></p>
    <p id="p-13">In May 2010, she took leave from <a id="p1253" href="#p1253" data-label="1253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1253</a>work to undergo carpel tunnel surgery.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Following <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>the surgery, she developed chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a condition that caused her debilitating pain in her upper extremities and severely impaired her ability to function. She never returned to work. The parties stipulated she became permanent and stationary on May 2, 2013.</p>
    <p id="p-14">In 2012 and 2013, petitioner was examined by an AME in orthopedics, Chester Hasday, M.D. Dr. Hasday found petitioner permanently and totally disabled from the labor market. He found that her permanent total disability was due entirely to the effects of the CRPS that she developed as a result of the failed carpal tunnel surgery. He further concluded that petitioner's carpal tunnel condition itself was 90 percent due to industrial factors and 10 percent to nonindustrial factors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a></p>
    <p id="p-15">In issuing the award, the WCJ found that petitioner's permanent total disability was 90 percent due to industrial factors, "after adjustment for apportionment." Petitioner sought reconsideration by the Board, contending her disability was 100 percent industrial because it derived from medical treatment, entitling her to an unapportioned award. The WCJ prepared a report and recommendation, in which he recommended denying the petition for reconsideration, stating that he was "obligated under Labor Code section 4663 to address apportionment of permanent disability to factors other than applicant's industrial injury."</p>
    <p id="p-16">On February 8, 2016, in a two-to-one decision, the Board affirmed the apportionment. The majority concluded: "To properly evaluate the issue of apportionment of permanent disability, it is necessary to 'parcel out' the causative sources of the permanent disability, nonindustrial, prior industrial and current industrial, and 'decide the amount directly caused by the current industrial source.' [Citation.] [¶] As the WCJ notes in the Report, the AME Dr. Hasday concluded that [petitioner's] CRPS caused her to be totally permanently disabled. However, there is a basis for apportionment of that permanent disability to nonindustrial causative sources as found by the WCJ because the CRPS was caused by the surgery to treat [petitioner's] carpal tunnel condition, which is 10 percent nonindustrial and 90 percent industrial as opined by Dr. Hasday. [Citation.]" (Quoting <em>Brodie v. Workers. Comp. Appeals Bd</em> . (2007) <a href="/cal-4th/40/1313-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="40 Cal. 4th 1313" data-case-ids="3158998" data-case-paths="/cal-4th/40/1313-01">40 Cal.4th 1313</a>, 1328, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20644" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="57 Cal.

The Board nonetheless granted the petition for reconsideration, finding the WCJ had failed to take into account medical reports showing <a id="p1254" href="#p1254" data-label="1254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1254</a>petitioner suffered employment-related psychiatric injuries that "need [ ] to be taken into account along with the other industrial causative sources in determining the level of compensable permanent disability resulting from the industrial injury."</p>
    <p id="p-17">The dissent, citing multiple cases holding that an employee is entitled to compensation for new or aggravated injury resulting from the medical or surgical treatment of an industrial injury, stated the WCJ erred "because he apportioned the permanent disability caused by [petitioner's] CRPS based upon the causation of [her] underlying carpal tunnel injury and not upon the cause of her permanent disability.... In that the CRPS causing [petitioner's] total permanent disability resulted entirely from the surgery reasonably performed to treat [her] industrial carpal tunnel injury, it is error to apportion the permanent disability resulting from that medical treatment based upon the causes <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>of the injury that was being treated." (Italics omitted.)</p>
    <p id="p-18">After the Board issued its February 2016 decision remanding the case, petitioner prepared a trial brief urging the WCJ to find her 100 percent disabled based on the psychiatric injury, which she alleged was entirely industrial. Petitioner further contended that the vocational expert's opinion supported a 100 percent award, and that a 100 percent award was required under section 4662, subdivision (b) due to her inability to fully use her arms and hands.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The WCJ increased petitioner's disability award to 98 percent after apportionment. Following issuance of the amended award, petitioner filed a second petition for reconsideration seeking increase in the award on a number of grounds, including the vocational expert's opinion and section 4662. She also asked the Board to revisit the appropriateness of apportionment. By order dated October 25, 2016, the Board again denied reconsideration, finding apportionment appropriate in a two-to-one decision for the reasons previously stated. The writ petition seeking review of the Board's decision was filed December 9, 2016.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a></p>

    <p id="p-20">A. <em>Timeliness of Appeal</em></p>
    <p id="p-21">Shortly before oral argument, respondents Costco and Helmsman filed a supplemental brief contending the Board's February 8, 2016 opinion was "likely" the "final decision" with respect to the apportionment issue, and that the appeal should be dismissed as untimely. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.</p>
    <p id="p-22">Section 5950 provides that "[a]ny person affected by an order, decision, or award of the [Board] may ... apply to the Supreme Court or to the court of appeal for the appellate district in which he resides, for a writ of review...." The petition for writ of review must be filed "within 45 days after a petition for reconsideration is denied, or, if a petition is granted or reconsideration is had on the appeal board's own motion, within 45 days after the filing of the order, decision, or award following reconsideration." (§ 5950.) "The failure of an aggrieved party to seek judicial review of a final order of the [Board] bars later challenge to the propriety of the order or decision before either the [Board] or the court." (<em>State Farm General Ins. Co. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd</em> . (2013) <a href="/cal-app-4th/218/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="218 Cal.

At the same time, courts have recognized that permitting early appellate review to resolve certain "threshold issues" may enhance rather than detract from the expeditious resolution of workers' compensation claims. (<em>Safeway Stores</em> , <em>supra</em> , at p. 533, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20750" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="163 Cal.

    <p id="p-24">In general, a threshold issue is one "crucial to the employee's right to receive benefits." (<em>Maranian</em> , <em>supra</em> , 81 Cal.App.4th at p. 1078, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20418" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="97 Cal.

The fact that an issue is significant or important to the litigation is not sufficient to support a finding that it is a threshold issue. As the court stated in <em>Ogden Entertainment Services v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd</em> . (2014) <a href="/cal-app-4th/233/0970-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="233 Cal.

Rptr. 3d 205">183 Cal.Rptr.3d 205</a> although the determination "[w]hether the [worker's] psychiatric injury was industrial" was "one of the principal issues" before the Board, "[t]he disposition by the appeals board of one of several issues on the merits is not a final decision of the appeals board"; "[i]t is only a final order, decision or award of the appeals board that is reviewable by this court by way of a petition for a writ of review."<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a></p>
    <p id="p-25">The Board's February 2016 decision was not a final order disposing of the case, as it remanded the matter to the WCJ to determine the amount of compensation to be awarded for the psychiatric disability and other issues raised by petitioner. Nor was the Board's decision on apportionment a threshold issue, "crucial to [petitioner's] right to receive benefits." (<em>Maranian</em> , <em>supra</em> , 81 Cal.App.4th at p. 1078, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20418" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="97 Cal. Rptr. 2d 418">97 Cal.Rptr.2d 418</a>.) Petitioner was entitled to benefits regardless of apportionment, and respondents essentially conceded petitioner's disability was at least 90 percent the result of industrial factors. On remand to <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>the WCJ, petitioner advanced multiple theories to warrant a 100 percent award without regard to apportionment. By maximizing her award in the workers' compensation proceedings before resorting to the courts, petitioner was following a path that could have led to an expeditious resolution of the proceeding without the need for appellate review. We discern no reason an applicant should be compelled to seek immediate writ review of an issue that may not be dispositive of his or her award. In short, we conclude petitioner's pursuit of her claim to its conclusion, in lieu of seeking review of the Board's <a id="p1257" href="#p1257" data-label="1257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1257</a>February 2016 decision, did not represent disregard of a final order. Accordingly, we deny respondent's request for dismissal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a></p>
    <p id="p-26">B. <em>Merits</em></p>
    <p id="p-27">We turn now to the merits of petitioner's assertion that the Board erred when it found that despite the AME's unchallenged opinion that petitioner's CRPS resulting from the failed surgery rendered her totally disabled, the Board deemed her permanent total disability to be 90 percent due to industrial factors after apportionment.</p>
    <p id="p-28">The Board's conclusions on questions of law are reviewed de novo. (<em>Benson v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd</em> . (2009) <a href="/cal-app-4th/170/1535-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="170 Cal.

The rule "left employers liable for any portion of a disability that would not have occurred but for the current industrial cause; if the disability arose in part from an interaction between an industrial cause and a nonindustrial cause, but the nonindustrial cause would not alone have given rise to a disability, no apportionment was to be allowed."

    <p id="p-40">Here, there is no dispute that the disabling carpal tunnel syndrome from which petitioner suffered was largely the result of her many years of clerical employment with Costco. It followed that Costco was required to provide medical treatment to <a id="p665" href="#p665" data-label="665" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*665</a>resolve the problem, without apportionment. The surgery went badly, leaving appellant with a far more disabling condition-CRPS-that will never be alleviated. California workers' compensation law relieves Costco of liability for any negligence in the provision of the medical treatment that led to petitioner's CRPS. It does not relieve Costco of the obligation to compensate petitioner for this disability without apportionment.</p>
    <p id="p-41">Our review of the authorities convinces us that in enacting the "new regime of apportionment based on causation," the Legislature did not intend to transform the law requiring employers to pay for all medical treatment caused by an industrial injury, including the foreseeable consequences of such medical treatment. Pre-2004 law constraining the application of apportionment in the award of permanent disability benefits was based primarily on the interpretation of former sections 4663 and 4750, which were eliminated or fundamentally altered by the 2004 amendments. The longstanding rule that <a id="p1263" href="#p1263" data-label="1263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*1263</a>employers are responsible for all medical treatment necessitated in any part by an industrial injury, including new injuries resulting from that medical treatment, derived not from those statutes, but from (1) the concern that applying apportionment principles to medical care would delay and potentially prevent an injured employee from getting medical care; and (2) the fundamental proposition that workers' compensation should cover all claims between the employee and employer arising from work-related injuries, leaving no potential for an independent suit for negligence against the employer. Nothing in the 2004 legislation had any impact on the reasoning that has long supported the employer's responsibility to compensate for medical treatment and the consequences of medical treatment without apportionment. Accordingly, the WCJ erred in relying on the 2004 amendment to support apportioning petitioner's award, and the Board erred in upholding his decision.</p>

In <em>Chimeri</em>, the employee became disabled after breaking his foot at work, which led him to suffer CRPS and become addicted to pain medication. The permanent total disability there was 100 percent work related. In <em>Nilsen</em>, the employee similarly suffered a serious injury at work leading to CRPS and dependency on pain medication. The defendant sought to attribute some of the disability to the employee's pre-existing back condition, but the Board found no evidence that his preexisting back condition had contributed to his disability. In <em>Moran</em>, the employee suffered two injuries at work, and the issue was whether apportionment between the prior injury and the current injury was warranted. The Board found the defendant had failed to meet its burden of proving the prior injury overlapped the current one. Of the cited cases, only <em>Steinkamp</em> addressed the issue squarely. There, the employee's cumulative knee injury was the result of various factors, some industrial and some not. He underwent knee surgery, which led to permanent disability. The Board concluded apportionment was not warranted because "medical treatment is not apportionable." However, <em>Steinkamp</em> was not designated a significant panel decision and its precedential value is limited.</p>
      <p id="p-63">Petitioner further contends this matter was resolved in <em>Escobedo v. Marshalls</em>, in which the Board stated: "Section 4663(a)'s statement that the apportionment of permanent disability shall be based on 'causation' refers to the causation of the permanent disability, not causation of the injury, and the analysis of the causal factors of permanent disability for purposes of apportionment may be different from the analysis of the causal factors of the injury itself." (<em>Escobedo v. Marshalls, supra,</em> 70 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 607.) In <em>Escobedo</em>, the employee's disability was not the result of medical treatment. The Board addressed apportionment where the disability was caused 50 percent by an industrial injury and 50 percent by a preexisting degenerative condition.
